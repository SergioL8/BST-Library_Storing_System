# Library storing system - Binary Search tree

## Description
This project is a fully functional storage system for a library. The goal was to create an efficient system to store and retrieve books quickly, regardless of the library's size, which can range into the thousands of books. Quick search times are maintained even with a large inventory.

## Key features
The cornerstone of this project is the implementation of a binary tree. Binary trees are a type of data structure that keeps search times logarithmic with respect to the number of items (log(n)), making them an excellent choice for managing large datasets.

## Functionality
The application offers various features, including:

1. Printing the entire book collection.
2. Searching for books by title or author.
3. Identifying the highest-rated books.
4. Deleting a book record (useful in cases where a book is lost or removed from the collection)

For testing and demonstration purposes, the application includes a .csv file containing 300 book entries.

## Testing and usage

The application has undergone testing and is confirmed to be functioning as expected. Should you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out.
